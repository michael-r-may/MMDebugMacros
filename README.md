=============

This was curated and created by @codermay I'm just moving it to Github so whenever I want to use this awesome set of Macros I don't need to spend 15 minutes looking in the internet for his blog :).

The original article and code can be found here: http://codermay.co.uk/blog/debug-macros-functions/

Please again all work was done by Michael May (@codermay) on twitter.
